              <p id='description'>The target audience for this poster was new EMU students, so the biggest priority was giving these new people a feeling of belonging and welcomeness. stylistic elements such as the 3 lines spelling out “EMU” vertically were used to give the piece a more playful tone and to help advertise this idea to the new students coming in. I wanted to also make sure the tone was as clear as possible, so I chose a simple image with text format and took creative liberties from there. I chose a darker photo to give each element a chance to stand out more.
