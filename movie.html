              <p id='description'>As an introduction to animation and Adobe After Effects, I really wanted to try as many tools and filters as possible to really give myself a better grasp of the program. I also wanted to make sure that each effect played into the movie that I chose for this assignment, so adding silhouettes and shadows for a movie such as Indiana Jones made sense to me since the movies themselves also use these types of effects.
