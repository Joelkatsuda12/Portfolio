              <p id='description'>For me, this project was an introduction to HTML, CSS as well as web design as a whole. Since the guidelines were broad for this assignment, several different HTML tags were used such as text inputs, buttons, and lists. I spent a lot of time learning about how these tags were used in real world applications by taking inspiration from websites such as spotify.
