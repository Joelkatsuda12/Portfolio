              <p id='description'>During my time in a Fraternity I was in charge of creating a Dine and Donate event with Ypsilanti Nutrition as well as an advertisement for this event to display on social media. The biggest thing I wanted to do with this project was to play to the strengths of Ypsilanti Nutrition’s design traits to enhance the image of the company. This is why there is imagery of smoothies and fruits in the photo, and the text plays into the playfulness of Ypsilanti Nutrition’s typeface.
